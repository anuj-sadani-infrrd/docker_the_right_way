## Let us check the docker image size
`docker images|grep spacy`

# Now lets check if the docker base image can be changed
- We don't know whcih version of python is getting used?
- Are we using all python inbuild libraries or utilities?
Check the docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/_/python/tags?page=1&name=3.7

## Lets try the apline image
python:3.7.16-alpine

Lets observe what is happening here - it takes insane amount of time to build and fails
As it doesn not have support for builds or some compilarion binaries

Build the docker image (with tag as 2)
`docker build -t spacyapp:2 -f Dockerfile .`

> Build process failed

## Lets try slim
python:3.7.16-slim

Build the docker image (with tag as 2)
`docker build -t spacyapp:2 -f Dockerfile .`

> Build process succeed 

Run the new build
`docker run -p 5000:5000 --rm --name app spacyapp:2`

> run the curl to validate the changes are working

## Check the image size
`docker images|grep spacy`
 
 We see reduction in the docker image size

## To the base image with digest
FROM python:3.7.16-slim@sha256:d170d1a4c9ddaf4b0571f39733258af2aec9340f11176ccbd2cb6a3efaee33ec

The can be get from dockerhub. It makes sure we have the exact image even is the tag gets new changes.
