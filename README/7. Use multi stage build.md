## Change the Dockerfile

```
FROM python:3.7.16-slim as base

FROM base as builder

RUN mkdir /install
WORKDIR /install
COPY requirements.txt /requirements.txt
RUN pip install --prefix=/install -r /requirements.txt

FROM base

COPY --from=builder /install /usr/local

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

RUN python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

Build the docker image (with tag as 3)
`docker build -t spacyapp:3 -f Dockerfile .`

> Build process succeed 

Run the new build
`docker run -p 5000:5000 --rm --name app spacyapp:3`

> run the curl to validate the changes are working

## Check the image size
`docker images|grep spacy`
 
 We see reduction in the docker image size
